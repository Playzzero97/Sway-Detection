  ### üõ†Ô∏è First-Time Setup Recommendation

  I only recommend enabling this plugin when you're using **ETS2LA** for the **first time**, so you can fine-tune the **Steering Smoothness** setting.

  ### Where to Find It

  Go to:

  **Settings ‚Üí Map ‚Üí Steering**

  and adjust the **Smoothness** slider until your vehicle feels responsive but stable.

  ### Visual Example

  Below is an example of a sway detection notification:
